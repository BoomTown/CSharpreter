# Sublime Text 2: CSharpreter plugin

## Description

CSharpreter compiles and executes snippets of C# code. The currently-selected text (or entire contents of the view, if no text is selected) is injected into the body of the Main routine of a C# console application. MSBuild is invoked and the executable is run in a shell window.

## Settings

In the CSharpreter package folder, edit c_sharpreter.sublime-settings file to modify the defaults.

* msbuild_path: Path to the MSBuild executable
* default_usings: List of namespaces to inject at the top of the source file.
* main_end: List of statements to inject at the end of the Main method.

``` json CSharpreter settings

	"default_usings":

	],
	"main_end":

		"Console.WriteLine();",

		"Console.ReadKey();"
	]
